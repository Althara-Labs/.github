## ðŸ”Ž Problem

In many countries across **Latin America**, public procurement is one of the governmentâ€™s largest sources of spending â€” and one of the areas most exposed to corruption and inefficiency. Citizens frequently hear of overpriced contracts, projects that never finish, or tenders that appear to be decided behind closed doors.

Key issues include:

* **Opacity**: Procurement systems are often closed and fragmented, making it hard for citizens or journalists to follow the money.
* **Manipulation of processes**: Deadlines can change, requirements can be altered, and documents can disappear without a clear trace.
* **Limited accountability**: When contracts are awarded, the public has little way to verify why a certain bidder was chosen or whether the criteria were applied fairly.
* **Trust deficit**: Communities lose faith in public institutions when procurement processes are seen as unfair or corrupt.

This situation is especially critical in LATAM, where public trust in institutions is fragile and where efficient infrastructure and social projects are urgently needed. Lack of transparency directly impacts roads, hospitals, schools, and services that affect millions of people every day.

## âœ… Solution

**Althara Pacta** introduces a new way of managing tenders and bids by putting the entire process **on-chain** and making it fully auditable:

* **Onâ€‘chain procurement lifecycle**: From tender creation to bid submission to final award, every step is recorded immutably on Ethereum.
* **Verifiable documents**: All specifications, requirements, and submissions are stored through Filecoin Onchain Cloud, with CIDs guaranteeing that no file can be secretly modified or deleted.
* **Smart contract enforcement**: Deadlines, participation rules, and evaluation criteria are enforced automatically, preventing manual manipulation.
* **Public transparency**: A simple, accessible dashboard lets citizens, auditors, and journalists see tenders, bids, and outcomes in real time â€” without needing a crypto wallet to view.
* **Regional impact**: By applying this model in Latin America, governments can reduce corruption risks, foster trust with citizens, and ensure that public resources are invested where they are needed most.

In short: **Althara Pacta brings trust back to public procurement.** It creates a future where communities can see how decisions are made, verify that rules were followed, and demand accountability when they are not. This isnâ€™t just technology â€” itâ€™s a tool for better governance, stronger institutions, and fairer opportunities across LATAM.
